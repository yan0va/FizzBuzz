### FizzBuzz with a Pink Flamingo ###
--------------------------------------------------------

#### Task:

* Write a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 100.
 
* For multiple of three print <b>"Fizz"</b> instead of the number and for multiples of five print <b>"Buzz"</b>.
  
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print <b>"FizzBuzz"</b>.
  
* Then extend the program to say <b>"Flamingo"</b> when a number is a member of the Fibonacci sequence, and <b>"Pink Flamingo"</b> when it is a multiple of three and five and a member of the Fibonacci sequence.

Hint:

A number is Fibonacci if and only if one or both of (5*n2 + 4) or (5*n2 - 4) is a perfect square
(i.e. A number made by squaring a whole number).
